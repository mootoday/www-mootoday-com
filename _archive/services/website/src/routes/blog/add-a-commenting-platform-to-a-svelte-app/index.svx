Happy new year!

I recently [relaunched](https://www.mikenikles.com/blog/migrating-from-medium-to-my-own-blog) my personal blog at www.mikenikles.com using Svelte ([learn why](https://www.mikenikles.com/blog/why-i-moved-from-react-to-svelte-and-why-others-will-follow)).

Initial feedback was to allow visitors to leave comments and have discussions. I took that feedback and found www.commento.io which looked lightweight enough and straitforward to implement.

What I did:

1.  Sign up at www.commento.io
2.  Create a Svelte component that displays comments

The component is as simple as this ([corresponding pull request](https://github.com/mikenikles/www-mikenikles-com/pull/4/files)):

```svelte
<svelte:head>
  <script src="https://cdn.commento.io/js/commento.js"></script>
</svelte:head>

<h2>Comments, Feedback, Thoughts</h2>
<div id="commento" />
```

## Configuration

You can style the commenting platform by providing a `data-css-override` attribute to the `script` tag, for example:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.commento.io/js/commento.js" data-css-override="http://example.com/my-custom-styling.css"></script>
```

Additional configuration options can be found in [the documentation](https://docs.commento.io/configuration/frontend/).

Are there other alternatives you have experience with? What do you like / dislike about them?
